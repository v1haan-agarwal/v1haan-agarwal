# Hi, I’m Vihaan

## About me

I'm a hands on engineer who studied mechanical engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I have made this Github to showcase some of the projects I undertook during my time at college.

## Projects

- **[Project 1](https://github.com/v1haan-agarwal/Automatic-Slicer):** An automated slicer that was designed with a very human-centered solution tailored to individuals with dexterity limitations, such as having reduced arm, wrist hand or finger mobility.
- **[Project 2](https://github.com/v1haan-agarwal/Manual-Transmission-System):** A novel manual transmission system that has the ability to create forward and backward motion and brake at will. Created to get a broader idea of transmission systems and the complexity of a relatively standardized system these days.
